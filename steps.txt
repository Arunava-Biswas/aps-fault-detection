Step1: 
- Whether git is install or not? To check just type "git" in the terminal.
- Here we are creating the project with python 3.8.10 version.
- The default mongoDB connection is: "mongodb://localhost:27017", it can be found in the 'main.py' file.





Step2:
- Create dataset inside the mongoDB database.
- To download the dataset from 'git' we use the command 'wget' in terminal.
- To download the data write in the following format and hit enter:
    wget url
- As here it is:
abc@4816ef265cb4:~/workspace$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avnyadav/sensor-fault-detection/main/aps_failure_training_set1.csv
- After doing this the dataset gets downloaded.
- Now we need to upload the data to mongoDB. To do this we will create the 'data_dump.py' file.





Step3:
- Now we will read the data from the mongoDB and do the Machine Learning project.
- But before we need to add this codes in the github using git commands.
- So go to github and create a new repo. While creating repo (aps-fault-detection) just select Add.gitignore option as 'python'.
- 1st we need to see is there any repositore already attach to this code or not? to check type the following command
    git remote -v

abc@4816ef265cb4:~/workspace$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/iNeuron-Pvt-Ltd/neurolab-mongodb-python (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/iNeuron-Pvt-Ltd/neurolab-mongodb-python (push)

- Now to remove the origin so we can create our own repo as origin type:
    git remote remove origin
- Again to check just type:
    git remote -v

abc@4816ef265cb4:~/workspace$ git remote remove origin
abc@4816ef265cb4:~/workspace$ git remote -v

- Now we need to add our repo as origin type:
    git remote add origin <give your url>

abc@4816ef265cb4:~/workspace$ git remote add origin https://github.com/Arunava-Biswas/aps-fault-detection.git
abc@4816ef265cb4:~/workspace$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Arunava-Biswas/aps-fault-detection.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Arunava-Biswas/aps-fault-detection.git (push)

- Now we need to push the changes to make the changes applicable. Here do the authentication steps to allow the repo to joined with this project. type:
    git push origin main

- Here we will get some error message, as there are changes ('.gitignore' file) in the github repo which are not shown here on this project so to make them one first we have to fetch (pull the changes from the github to the local system) the repo here then create the commit and then do the push. This is the 'merge conflict'.

- So either we need to delete the commits in the github repo or we need to delete the commits in our local system as the problem is that the commits are not matching. Here we are deleting the commits in the local repo.
- Go to hidden folder '.git'

abc@4816ef265cb4:~/workspace$ ls -a
.  ..  aps_failure_training_set1.csv  data_dump.py  .git  main.py  README.md  requirements.txt  steps.txt  .vscode

- Now go to inside the '.git' folder

abc@4816ef265cb4:~/workspace$ cd .git/
abc@4816ef265cb4:~/workspace/.git$ ls
branches  config  description  FETCH_HEAD  HEAD  hooks  index  info  logs  objects  ORIG_HEAD  packed-refs  refs

- We need to use the following command:
    git reset --soft ID
- The ID is the id of the commit where we want the pointer HEAD to move.
- With soft the codes remained.

abc@4816ef265cb4:~/workspace$ git reset --soft 6afd

- Now we can create a new commit and push it to the repository.

abc@4816ef265cb4:~/workspace$ git add .
abc@4816ef265cb4:~/workspace$ git status
On branch main

 - Here we need to push forcefully

abc@4816ef265cb4:~/workspace$ 

- Now create a file '.gitignore'
- Then again add, commit and push this to the github repo.
- The usage of ".gitignore":
    - In the source folder may be there are files which we don't want git to track, i.e. we want to prevent git from tracking those files and folders. We put those files and folders in this file.
    - Also we can prevent a very large file from getting uploaded to github by this method.





Step4
- To start a Python project the first file to be created is the 'setup.py' file.
- This 'setup.py' file is important so later we can convert our source code into library format to use it elsewhere. Example we install Pandas package to use different modules from it. So the main usage of this file is to ensure the distribution of the source code.
- Now we can create a folder here named 'sensor' inside which all the source codes will be available. So this 'sensor' folder is the Python package that we described in the setup section of the 'setup.py' file.
- Because of some specific files in the 'sensor' folder the find_packages() is able to identify as the Python package. This specific file is '__init__.py'
- So any folder contains the file '__init__.py', the 'find_packages()' will consider that folder as the Python package/library.
- Every source code requires some other libraries, so to specify the other libraries for the project we define them with 'get_requirements()'
- Here in the requirements.txt file we have used a '-e .' at the end. The usage of this is to trigger the codes in the 'setup.py' file. So this '-e .' is very important if our source code is to be used as library.
- Here 'e' means editable installation and '.' is to direct to the current directory.
